# isGVD
A SageMath program to check the geometric vertex decomposability property of ideals.

This Sage notebook contains several functions, most notable is the `isGVD` function.
Taking any polynomial ideal, stored as a string, as input, this function returns whether or not the ideal is geometrically vertex decomposable.

This software was developed during an NSERC USRA, supervised by Sergio Da Silva, Jenna Rajchgot, and Adam VAn Tuyl.

## Caveat emptor

This is a scrappy first attempt at code for geometric vertex decomposability of ideals.
With [Adam Van Tuyl](https://ms.mcmaster.ca/~vantuyl/), we are developing a _Macaulay2_ package [GeometricDecomposability](https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2/wiki/Project%3A-Geometric-Vertex-Decomposition) which builds upon this code, adds functionailty, and improves usabliity.

## Example

The following ideal is geometrically vertex decomposable [[1]](#KleinRajchgot21).
We use `show_output=False` to hide intermediate output.

```{python}
isGVD('ideal(y*(z*s-x^2), y*w*r, w*r*(z^2 + z*x + w*r + s^2))', show_output=False)
```

This is test case 1 in the notebook and it returns `True`.
By default, the option `show_output` is set to `True`.
In this case, every intermediate geometric vertex decomposition and all the C_{y,I} and N_{y,I} ideals are shown, as well as any warnings.

```{python}
isGVD('ideal(y*(z*s-x^2), y*w*r, w*r*(z^2 + z*x + w*r + s^2))')
```
Has the following output.

```
